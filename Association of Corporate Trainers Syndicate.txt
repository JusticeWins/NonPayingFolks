Brothers & Sisters - 


The points to note and queries are updated and added each time when the list is published. So please read it completely to get the essence. Please read the FAQ section without fail.


Points to be noted


       	1	Nobody should accept any trainings from them from the below list of 

consultancies. 


2	Don’t argue about the reason why this consultancy was banned. We have 

collected from many whatsapp group and email link chains.


3	Remember, as a trainer when you get the training from one of them below you 

are killing yourself as well as you are killing one of your fellow brothers.


4	Till we form a trainer syndicate we don’t have control over the consultancies.


5	 Guys I know you are all top contractors, freelancers and intellectuals. So please 

stop arguing on asking tell the experience, what did they do etc.., We have talked 

enough for months together and it is high time we start taking action. If you need to help in any way, add more trainers to the group.


6	Believe me I am hearing a lot from consultancies for the last two months that 

trainers have formed a syndicate and they are rejecting trainings. It has started happening, but we should stay focused and persistent and we need a little more help from other trainers to get this 100% done.

		

7	Please add more trainers to the group, So the syndicate becomes stronger.


		8	Three trainers have to vouch for a consultancy to be included in the list.

		9	FAQ’s - Asked repeatedly both by trainers and vendors.


Please don’t ask repeated questions mentioned below. They are all tried and we 

didn’t get enough cooperation from the trainers. You can try any of the them and you can invite us all.

			

			9.1 Why don’t you build a blog and put this info. 

       Answer: Tried but doesn’t reach enough 

      audience. You can try and build one.


9.2 Why don’t we add a google docs spreadsheet and all trainers update it. 

Answer: Tried but no trainers took pain in updating.


9.3 Why don’t we build a portal and every trainer update there. 

Answer: Please build one. We are all waiting.


9.4 Why don’t you go to police station or a consumer court.

Answer: If you have the time, energy and money go. Nobody is stopping you.


9.5 Don’t accept any trainings without a PO.

Answer: Every trainer knows about this. PO is bare minimal document for any training.


9.6	Ask for a rating from participants one day before, last day before, last day, first day etc.., etc.., etc..,

Answer: Every trainer would have got feedback and even if you get 5 on 5 rating, the payment got cut. That’s the reason we are doing this activity of putting them in the banned list.


9.7	Ask for an advance 50% payment.

Answer: It is up to you. If you get 50 % advance it is always the best.



9.8 	Learn a new skill to enrich you

Answer: Everybody is a intellectual contractor here. So everybody knows that to keep you busy you need to take trainings on multiple technologies. 


9.9	In general try avoid talking or exercise caution when talking to specific people mentioned below. They are rude and will take you for a ride.


Answer:

Avinash of IIHT. He is so rude and doesn’t respect anyone in this world.

Vijay of coalesce. He is good for nothing guy.

	

			9.10 	Send me a individual message and I will publish the actual incident so 

that it will help others.


9.11	Why are you publishing this list. If a person has the ability to take of himself and willing to take the risk then he should be allowed to do so and should not be imposed any restrictions.


Answer: Yes of course. No one is imposing any restrictions on you. Up to your own will 

and wish to try for yourself. We just say if you touch fire, it will hurt you, if you want you touch it, go ahead.

The consultancies have gone beyond control and we are trying to control. They have taken the trainers as a granted idiots, so that is the reason this activity is been conducted.



			9.12 	There are some people who talk favor for a vendor.


We are not saying everyone is bad. The people who are not listed below are all good. So go and do business with them who are not listed. The community of trainers is a vast ocean. Nobody can verify the authenticity of each and every trainer. The trainer who talks in favor for a vendor who is in banned list is likely to have a benefit with that vendor by some other means or he himself is a vendor. Any debated topics with such kind of person will just be ignored.



9.13 Does that mean that the consultancy once banned will never be unbanned.

			[OR] Can a consultancy cannot come out of the banned list.


Answer:  We don’t want  to hurt anyone's  business. We as trainers know what it is to hurt someone, because all of the vendors have hurt us so badly. Once we get positive vote from 5+ trainers for a particular consultancy then that consultancy will be taken out from the list. We give chance to everyone to rectify their mistake.



9.14 Who are you to do this activity ? Go and mind your own business. 

Are you the guardian of the galaxy ? You are a jobless person, go do your job.


Yes. you are correct. We wanted to mind our own business only, but the vendor companies didn’t leave us peacefully to do our business. So as a victims we started to modularize the activity.


I am not the “guardian of the galaxy”, but I am the “guardian of all the trainers in India”. I did not choose this post. You guys made me to do it.


In our country, “A farmers enemy is a farmer only” like so, “ A trainers enemy is an another trainer only” We didn’t have unity among trainers. I have started the unification. It took me almost three years, to understand this vendor mafia model and I started fighting. I am seeing the benefits for the last 8 months.


I heard many trainers tried this unification but eventually failed. But I won’t back track till this comes to a substantial form.


			9.15 The people publishing this list are misleading trainers. Why are guys 

creating a scene.


This comment is usually said by vendors. We got numerous appreciations from trainers for this activity. But there is heavy noise from the vendors because of this conglomeration. 


We wanted this noise. Shout at us, debate with us, hit at us.

“Only after the storm, comes the calm”. At last it is only one thing that I wanted - “All trainers should be benefited”. Since this comment has come up I am also adding a list of good vendors who pay their trainers promptly.


9.16 There is a low commercial picked by trainer and a low commercial quoted by vendor.


There is wrong on both sides.


Trainer: As far as the trainer is concerned, please do not agree for a low commercial. 

For example, a big data training is worth 30 K per day in the market but I have seen trainers doing the training for 8K/day. Because of this one trainer, the client and the vendor play on all the trainers life. You can do it for 20K, which is decent but too much low rate has hit you as well as other trainers.


Vendor: Please quote a high rate for the client. When there is a rate rationalization then both the trainers and vendors would be benefited.


Right now it is only the client who is benefited, neither the Trainer nor the Vendor is benefited.



9.17 Politeness to trainers


More important guys, we want the vendor to talk politely to a trainer. If you shout, or intimidate a trainer, then the vendor would be put in banned list and the specific instance will be mentioned too. A trainer is not a servant to you, he is superior breed of elite contractor.


For eg: Avinash of IIHT talks to trainers like a king/servant model. Avinash being the king and the trainer being the servant.


Please don’t ask or debate on the same questions said above. We have debated enough and every trainer knows about these stuff. We cannot answer each and every question from a vendor or a trainer, so I have prepared this list of FAQ.
